# 📋 INVOICE CONTROLLER REFACTORING

## ✅ **REFACTORING COMPLETED**

### 🔄 **Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Created Dedicated InvoiceController**
- **New File**: `app/Http/Controllers/InvoiceController.php`
- **Method**: `show($order_id)` - Display invoice for specific order
- **Purpose**: Better separation of concerns

#### 2. **Moved Invoice Logic**
- **From**: `CheckoutController::showInvoice()`
- **To**: `InvoiceController::show()`
- **Code**: Identical functionality, cleaner organization

#### 3. **Updated Routes**
- **File**: `routes/web.php`
- **Old**: `[CheckoutController::class, 'showInvoice']`
- **New**: `[InvoiceController::class, 'show']`
- **Route Name**: `invoice.show` (unchanged)

#### 4. **Added Import**
- Added `use App\Http\Controllers\InvoiceController;`
- Simplified route definition

### 🎯 **Benefits:**

#### ✅ **Better Code Organization:**
- **Separation of Concerns** - Invoice logic separated from checkout

- Clear place for invoice-related methods
- Better testing isolation

### 🔍 **Verification:**
